      "description": "Developed a robust machine learning (ML) model to predict diabetes and heart disease using patient medical records üìä. Dataset includes age, gender, blood pressure, BMI, and glucose levels. After testing several ML algorithms, Random Forest outperformed others, achieving over 90% accuracy üéØ. This project highlights ML's potential in early disease detection, helping healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and implement preventive measures. Future work will refine these models and explore additional features to improve prediction accuracy.",

      "description": "Developed a hand gesture recognition system for gaming using OpenCV and TensorFlow. This project captures and classifies hand movements to interact with game functions in real-time. For example, in a game like Temple Run, gestures can control actions such as jumping or moving right/left or sliding. The system detects hand gestures from live video feeds, processes the images, and accurately recognizes the gestures to enhance the gaming experience.",
